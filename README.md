# Linear-discriminant-Analysis-LDA-for-Wine-Dataset
Linear discriminant Analysis(LDA) for Wine Dataset of Machine Learning

Requirements

1. import numpy as np

2. import pandas as pd

3. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

4. sklearn

5. Wine dataset

This Program is About Linear Discriminant analysis of Wine dataset.

I have used Jupyter console.

Along with Clustering Visualization Accuracy using Classifiers Such as Logistic regression, KNN, Support vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision tree and Random forest Classifier is provided. To know the exactness in Accuracy Cohen Kappa is used.
